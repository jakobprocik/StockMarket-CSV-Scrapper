# StockMarket-CSV-Scrapper



[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

With this small program it is possible to save the stock values of companies into a CSV file using "https://www.alphavantage.co/". Based on this CSV file images can be generated.

## Requirements
  - requests
  - csv
  - datetime
  - matplotlib

## Target scenarios
If you want to create a website and want to build a small database of the current stock companies first, it is faster with this program.


## Problems I encountered while coding
It was a new experience for me to work with CSV files and generate images with matplotlib. I think this experience can be very useful in the future to collect information and generate images.

**Project was for demonstration/learning purposes only**
